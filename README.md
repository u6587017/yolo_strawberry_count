# YOLO Strawberry Count
This project fine-tunes a YOLOv8 object detection model using a strawberry dataset from Kaggle to accurately detect and count strawberries in videos which includes:
### Fine-tuning YOLOv8 on a labeled strawberry image dataset

### Applying the trained model to video frames "test.mp4" for real-time strawberry detection 

### Counting the number of strawberries in each frame and aggregating the total
